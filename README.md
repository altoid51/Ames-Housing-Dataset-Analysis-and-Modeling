# Ames-Housing-Dataset-Analysis-and-Modeling
---
## Overview:
We will build regression and classification models using the training data. We expect that within this process, we'll be making use of the following:
- EDA
- Data Cleaning/Munging
- Visualization across predictive variables
- Grid Searching for hyper parameters
---
## Objectives
- Build a regression model using the features in the dataset to predict housing prices
- Build a classification model to predict the "Sale Condition" of the houses within the dataset
